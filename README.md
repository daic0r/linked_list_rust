# Doubly Linked List implementation in Rust

Decided to implement a linked list in Rust to practice using some lower level/unsafe features of Rust.

All in all, this went smoother than I'd expected, especially after hearing how notoriously hard it is to do this in Rust, but I guess this applies to not using `unsafe` code.

Complete with unit tests.

**Disclaimer**: of course for real-world applications you should use `LinkedList` from `std::collections`, this is just an exercise.

How to use:

Run
```
cargo build
```
to build.

Run
```
cargo test
```
to run the unit tests.

Run
```
cargo run
```
to run the sample program.
